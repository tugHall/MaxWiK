# Collaboration

Leveraging of MaxWiK package is free for any purpose. Adjusting hyperparameters for the particular task and certain datasets is the issue of collaboration. To get hyperparameters we use our Know-How algorithm which cannot be distributed freely. In each specific case this is being discussed, but in general the rules are as follow:

-   for **commercial purpose** the adjusting of hyperparameters including Matrix of Voronoi sites is under commercial offer. Copyrights of hyperparameters' dataset belong to customers.

-   for **research purpose** the adjusting of hyperparameters including Matrix of Voronoi sites is the cooperation issue. Copyrights of hyperparameters' dataset belong to us.
